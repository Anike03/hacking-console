# 🧠 Hacking Console

A futuristic, terminal-style hacking interface built for fun, simulation, and educational purposes. Inspired by classic cyberpunk and sci-fi aesthetics, this console mimics the feel of a hacker's terminal in a cinematic universe.

## 🔥 Features

- 💻 Terminal-like interface with real-time typing effects
- 🔐 Simulated brute-force and password cracking modules
- 🌐 Network scanning animation
- 🗂️ File explorer with simulated system files
- 🧩 Customizable themes (Matrix, Dark Web, Cyber Blue)

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The app begins by displaying an exciting **gift card offer** from popular brands like:
   - Amazon
   - Starbucks
   - Apple

2. Users are asked to **fill out a form** to "claim their prize".

3. Once submitted, the screen transforms into a **fake hacking console**:
   - Terminal-style animations
   - Glitch effects and fake system messages
   - "System Breach" messages with typing effects

> ⚠️ **Note:** This app does NOT perform any actual hacking or data collection. It’s 100% visual and meant for **pranks only**.
